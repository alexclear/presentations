* Hello, my name is Sasha...
* A word "modern" is probably not in the right place
* Let's discuss history a bit (a picture of a cassette)
* Procedural programming
* How a DSP programmer writes in C#
* How a C++ programmer writes in Java
* Bizzare optimizations: need to find a good case
* A need for OOP
* The object paradigm has failed
* General use languages: Python as a lingua franca
* Parts of a good modern language: (optional) static typing
* PHP 7, and mypy in Python
* Parts of a good modern language: package/vendoring manager
* Parts of a good modern language: metaprogramming, immutability, null-safety
* Use libraries, not frameworks!
* Need for speed: JIT compilers
* Need for speed: zero-cost abstractions
* FRP and Elm, zero-cost abstractions again
* Haskell (my VAZ2101 experience)
* Conclusions
* Questions, if any
* Farewell and thanks for all the fish
