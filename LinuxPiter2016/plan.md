* _Hello, my name is Sasha..._
* _Performance optimization is not that hard (how to draw an owl)_
* _A word on comfort zone? (This presentation is in LaTeX)_
* _Fast-forward to late 2016... (Brendan Gregg declared Linux DTrace-complete)_
* _Okay, Linux than... so what am I going to present?_
* _A web service for collecting and visualizing flamegraphs_
* Flamegraphs? (Do you remember Linux Piter 2015? Have you ever heard of Brendan Gregg?)
* _Collecting flamegraphs in 2016 is extremely easy (how to draw an owl)_
* On-CPU flamegraphs (the easy part)
* perf events
* BPF stack tracing capabilities
* Oh, by the way, BPF is...
* Off-CPU flamegraphs (the hard part)
* The problem: off-CPU operations are off the CPU, so how to account them?
* The solution is a bit ugly...
* Okay, back to the web service - we need a language
* A hicker needs decent boots (a picture of Asolo boots)
* _Vote for LISP, make programming great again!_
* _Homoiconicity, macros, immutability, lambdas_
* _Golang is not an option, but... (statically linked file is a must)_
* _Maybe I should elaborate WHY Golang is not an option_
* _Common LISP (statically linked file over 30Mbs)_
* _Scheme (designed to be minimalist and definitely is)_
* _So, no boots? (A puss-in-boots image from Shrek)_
* _Nim!_
* _Nim: the good parts (static and strong typing, homoiconicity, optional immutability, C as an IR, per thread GC, statically linked file < 1Mb)_
* Nim: the bad parts (concurrency is a bit tricky, don't forget to open a channel, creating new threads are a bit unclear)
* The project repo
* The project interface (should be quite ugly)
* The TODO list (a link to)
* _Conclusions_
* _Questions, if any_
* _Farewell and thanks for all the fish_
