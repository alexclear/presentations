* Hello, my name is Sasha...
* Performance optimization is not that hard (how to draw an owl)
* Fast-forward to late 2016... (Brendan Gregg declared Linux DTrace-complete)
* Okay, Linux than... so what am I going to present?
* A web service for collecting and visualizing flamegraphs
* Flamegraphs? (Do you remember Linux Piter 2015? Have you ever heard of Brendan Gregg?)
* Collecting flamegraphs in 2016 is extremely easy (how to draw an owl)
* On-CPU flamegraphs (the easy part)
* perf events
* BPF stack tracing capabilities
* Oh, by the way, BPF is...
* Off-CPU flamegraphs (the hard part)
* The problem: off-CPU operations are off the CPU, so how to account them?
* The solution is a bit ugly...
* Okay, back to the web service - we need a language
* A hicker needs decent boots
* Vote for LISP, make programming great again!
* Homoiconicity, macros, immutability, lambdas
* Golang is not an option, but... (statically linked file is a must)
* Maybe I should elaborate WHY Golang is not an option
* Common LISP (statically linked file over 30Mbs)
* Scheme (designed to be minimalist and definitely is)
* So, no boots? (A puss-in-boots image from Shrek)
* Nim!
* Nim: the good parts (homoiconicity, optional immutability, C as an IR, per thread GC, statically linked file < 1Mb)
* The project repo
* The project interface (should be quite ugly)
* The TODO list
* Conclusions
* Questions, if any
* Farewell and thanks for all the fish
